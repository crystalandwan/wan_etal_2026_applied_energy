What does "forced" mean?	Forced means "unplanned" outages			
MED or "med"?				Major Event Day calculated for the individual utility whereas if utility X had a MED, their outage values are explicitly excluded or included in the totals			
MED excl					Values are excluded if they are part of a specific utilities MED			
MED only					Values are included only if they are part of a specific utilities MED			


If there's no "excl" or "only" in the sheet name, then all forced outages are included, i.e. MED included				
"Combined" = "Comb excl MED" + "Comb only MED"

It is entirely plausible you will be able to associate a specific weather day to a part of a region, which may enable you to pinpoint a utility by name.

Please urge caution upon learning of any correlations, and do not share such findings.
