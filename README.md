## Abstract
Power outage datasets report on the spatial and temporal characteristics of customers without electricity. They have been used to understand vulnerabilities and resilience and to provide insights into trends in reliability and compliance. We compare two United States outage datasets, EAGLE-I and IEEE, from 2018-2022 to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses for different scientific questions and identify complementarities. The datasets differ in collection methodologies and in temporal and spatial scales. EAGLE-I captures a snapshot of outages sourced from the web, whereas IEEE compiles data from utilities directly. We use outage statistics, correlations of daily Customers Interrupted (CI), and case studies of extreme events to illustrate their differences. Despite processing the datasets to a common spatial and temporal resolution, direct comparisons are challenging due to differences in their methodologies and data collection approaches. EAGLE-I covers a larger share of customers, contributing to systematically higher CI and the associated estimated Customer Minutes Interrupted (CMI). Pooled across NERC reliability regions, we find weak linear mapping in CI between the two datasets, indicating that, in general, their trends in reliability metrics would not be consistent. Consistency is higher for some NERC regions, specifically Florida, Northwest, Southwest Power Pool, and Texas. EAGLE-I is advantageous for fine-scale, event-focused analysis. The IEEE data is more suitable for long-term regional benchmarking and analyses that support mapping between power outages and evolving asset characteristics. We conclude that efforts to promote coordination and harmonization between the datasets are needed to expand analytical capabilities about reliability events.
