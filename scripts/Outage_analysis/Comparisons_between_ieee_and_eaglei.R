# Title: Comparisons between IEEE and EAGLE-I
# Author: Heng Wan
# Date: 2025-10-30
# Purpose: This script performs a comparison of power outage metrics between EAGLE-I and 
#          IEEE data. It first unify the spatial and temporal resolution of the two
#          datasets, and then performs statistical analysis to assess the correlations
#          between the two datasets.
# Description:
#   1. Loads geographic data (county-NERC mapping, time zones) and assigns NERC
#      subregions and local time zones to each county.
#   2. Reads raw 15-minute EAGLE-I outage data across multiple years, converts
#      timestamps to local time, and applies time zone adjustments.
#   3. Aggregates the 15-minute EAGLE-I data to daily metrics at the county level
#      using three methods: maximum customer impact, sum of positive increases in
#      customer impact, and total customer-minutes.
#   4. Further aggregates the daily county-level EAGLE-I metrics to NERC subregion level.
#   5. Loads and processes daily IEEE outage data, including calculating 3-day
#      moving averages and joining with IEEE customer count data.
#   6. Merges the processed NERC-level EAGLE-I and IEEE datasets.
#   7. Filters the combined dataset to a common analysis period and applies a
#      threshold for customer impact percentage to focus on significant events.
#   8. Calculates Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between various
#      EAGLE-I and IEEE metrics.
#   9. Generates scatter plots and box plots to visually compare the different
#      aggregation methods and the two data sources, both at the national (all NERC)
#      and individual NERC region levels.
# Requirements:
#   - R packages: `data.table`, `dplyr`, `sf`, `zoo`, `lubridate`, `here`.
#   - A `config.R` file located in `scripts/Outage_Analysis/` relative to `here::here()`,
#     defining paths, years, and specific FIPS codes for time zone handling.
#   - A separate script `Aggregate_eaglei_from_15min_to_daily.R` containing aggregation
#     functions, located as specified in `config.R`.
#   - Data files:
#     - `counties_in_NERC2020.shp`: County-to-NERC mapping.
#     - `Time_Zones.shp`: Time zone boundaries.
#     - `eaglei_outages_YYYY.csv`: Raw 15-minute EAGLE-I data (for each year).
#     - `combined.csv`: Daily IEEE outage data (CI, CMI).
#     - `customer counts.csv`: IEEE customer counts by NERC region and year.
#     (All paths are configured in `config.R`)
